# RAGAS Evaluation Report: real_rag_baseline

Generated on: 2025-08-04 20:40:16

## Overview

This report presents the RAGAS evaluation results for the Oncall Lens RAG system.

## Metrics Explanation

- **Faithfulness**: How well the generated answers are grounded in the retrieved context (higher is better)
- **Answer Relevancy**: How relevant the generated answers are to the questions (higher is better)  
- **Context Precision**: How precise/relevant the retrieved context is (higher is better)
- **Context Recall**: How complete the retrieved context is (higher is better)
- **Answer Similarity**: Semantic similarity between generated and ground truth answers (higher is better)
- **Answer Correctness**: Correctness of generated answers compared to ground truth (higher is better)

## Results

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Faithfulness | 0.000 | Needs Improvement |
| Answer Relevancy | 0.482 | Needs Improvement |
| Context Precision | 0.000 | Needs Improvement |
| Context Recall | 0.000 | Needs Improvement |
| Semantic Similarity | 0.453 | N/A |
| Answer Correctness | 0.159 | N/A |


## Analysis

### Strengths
- Metrics scoring above 0.8 indicate strong performance in those areas
- High faithfulness suggests good grounding in source material
- High answer relevancy indicates good question understanding

### Areas for Improvement  
- Metrics below 0.8 suggest opportunities for enhancement
- Low context precision/recall may indicate retrieval issues
- Consider advanced retrieval techniques for improvement

## Recommendations

Based on these results:

1. **If Context Precision < 0.8**: Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
2. **If Context Recall < 0.8**: Use parent document retriever for more complete context  
3. **If Faithfulness < 0.8**: Improve prompt engineering for better grounding
4. **If Answer Relevancy < 0.8**: Enhance question understanding and routing

## Next Steps

1. Implement recommended improvements
2. Re-run evaluation to measure impact
3. Compare results with baseline metrics
4. Consider A/B testing different retrieval strategies
