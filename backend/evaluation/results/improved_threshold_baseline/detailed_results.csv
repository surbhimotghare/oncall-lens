**Technical Summary: Hosted Graphite Outage on March 12th, 2014**

**Key Symptoms:**
- Complete loss of new incoming data to the Hosted Graphite service.

**Timeline:**
- Incident Date: March 12th, 2014
- Specific time details are not provided in the file.

**Immediate Evidence:**
- The file does not contain extracted error messages or specific system component failures.
- The absence of error logs suggests either a logging failure or an issue that did not trigger standard error reporting mechanisms.
