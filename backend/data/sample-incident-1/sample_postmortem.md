## Status

Complete, action items in progress

## Summary

Primary database connection pool exhausted during peak traffic hours, causing widespread API failures for 45 minutes.

## Impact

- **Duration**: 45 minutes (14:30 UTC to 15:15 UTC)
- **Affected Services**: User API, Payment Processing, Inventory Management
- **Error Rate**: 85% of API requests returned HTTP 500
- **User Impact**: ~50,000 users unable to complete purchases
- **Revenue Impact**: Estimated $125,000 in lost sales

## Root Causes

1. **Connection Pool Misconfiguration**: Maximum pool size set to 20 connections, insufficient for peak traffic
2. **Long-Running Queries**: Several analytics queries were holding connections for 30+ seconds
3. **Connection Leak**: Application code not properly closing connections in error scenarios
4. **Monitoring Gap**: No alerting on connection pool utilization

## Trigger

Combination of:
- Black Friday traffic spike (3x normal load)
- Scheduled analytics job running during peak hours
- Recent code deployment with connection leak bug

## Resolution

1. **Immediate**: Increased connection pool size from 20 to 100 connections
2. **Short-term**: Killed long-running analytics queries
3. **Medium-term**: Deployed hotfix for connection leak bug
4. **Long-term**: Moved analytics queries to read replica

## Detection

- **14:32 UTC**: First PagerDuty alert fired for API error rate > 50%
- **14:33 UTC**: Engineering team notified
- **14:35 UTC**: Incident declared and war room established

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 14:30 | Traffic begins spiking, connection pool starts filling |
| 14:31 | First connection timeouts observed |
| 14:32 | PagerDuty alert: API error rate critical |
| 14:33 | On-call engineer paged |
| 14:35 | Incident #2024-001 declared |
| 14:37 | Initial investigation shows database connectivity issues |
| 14:42 | Connection pool exhaustion identified as root cause |
| 14:45 | Emergency connection pool size increase deployed |
| 14:48 | Partial recovery observed (50% success rate) |
| 14:52 | Long-running queries identified and killed |
| 14:58 | Full service recovery achieved |
| 15:15 | Incident officially resolved after monitoring period |

| Load testing with realistic traffic patterns | process | sarah.jenkins | P1 | **TODO** |

## Lessons Learned

### What went well
- Rapid incident detection and escalation
- Effective war room coordination
- Quick identification of root cause
- Clear communication with stakeholders

### What went wrong
- Insufficient monitoring of critical infrastructure metrics
- Database connection limits not sized for peak traffic
- Analytics workload not properly isolated
- Code review missed connection leak in error paths

### Where we got lucky
- Issue occurred during business hours (engineering team available)
- Connection pool increase was straightforward configuration change
- No data corruption or consistency issues
- Customer support team proactively managed user communications
